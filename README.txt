README.txt

Bits of code used to access various museum APIs.  

I'm working in PHP/MySQL at the moment, and generally importing data to save APIs hits so that's what most of the scripts do to start with.

Currently working:

Science Museum 'Cosmic Collections' API
http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objectapi/cosmosculturepublic.svc/MuseumObjects

In progress:
Powerhouse Museum API
http://api.powerhousemuseum.com/

If you see ### that's a bit I have to go back and tidy - it's all a bit messy and very alpha.
